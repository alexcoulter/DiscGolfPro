## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to keep score while I play a round of disc golf.  I want to be able to input the course and layout I'm playing as well as the number of holes.  I would like to be able to input my score on a hole-by-hole basis and see a score card as well as my total score for the round.  I would like to have different gifs and images pop up that relate to how well I did on the previous hole.  I would also like this to be a Progressive Web App(PWA) that is mobile-first and can be loaded on my phone with a distinct icon.  It should also utilize the cache API to run even without a connection to the internet.
